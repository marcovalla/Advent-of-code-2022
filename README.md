## Advent of code 2022


Python resolution for the Advent of Code 2022


## Resolution


### Daily tasks

Each task is solved in a single .py file, one file for each day.

For example, for the tasks respecting to Day One, the file name will be: "day_one.py"

The problem description for each task are located in the folder: "Daily tasks"

### Inputs

Input validation for data types (e.g., expecting an integer) is **not** included. Entering an incorrect type (like a character instead of a number) will cause a runtime crash. Please ensure you enter the correct data types.

There is two ways to enter an input for the daily tasks

1. From a file

	The daily inputs are located in the folder: "Daily inputs"

2. From console

	The user may enter the character '.' in a new single line to finish the input

## Utils

The file "utils.py" contains the source code to manage inputs

## Main

The main.py file runs the daily tasks by calling the functions for each day
